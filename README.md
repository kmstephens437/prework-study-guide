# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## This wepage was built as a useful tool to help keep track of key study points for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git as we learn them in this bootcamp.
## It allows us to take notes and store them in one central location and to share them with anyone who may be in this class or have an interest otherwise. 
## The main area of growth for me during this project was learning the git flow process for the first time.
